# Smart_Parking_System
The tremendous growth in car numbers in cities throughout the world has swamped current parking infrastructures, posing substantial difficulties such as inefficient space usage, increased traffic congestion, and increasing driver discontent. We have created a cutting-edge smart parking system that uses automation and real-time data management to greatly increase parking efficiency and enhance user experiences in order to address these problems.
The smart parking system is built to improve consumer connection with the service by giving users rapid access to data through mobile applications and other digital interfaces.Furthermore, it facilitates remote monitoring, which enables parking lot managers to effectively supervise and maximize parking space utilization from a distance.
Our system's goals are simple but effective: by giving real-time information on available parking spaces, it reduces overall traffic congestion; by automating parking area management, it maximizes parking area utilization; and by improving user experience, it greatly increases user satisfaction and also helps in calculation of fare too.
Our system creates a smooth and effective parking management solution by integrating stateof-the-art components such as the Adafruit IoT cloud platform, MQTT and ESP8266 Node
MCU microcontrollers. 
Its automated car entrance and exit system, which includes one SG90-9G servo motor and five infrared sensors, streamlines and expedites the parking procedure. The ESP8266 Node MCU microcontroller, which serves as the system's brain, is at the centre of everything. The servo motor, infrared sensors, and larger cloud-enabled infrastructure are
all securely and robustly connected to this microcontroller via a skilful network of cables. With this configuration, the availability of each parking space can be managed and monitored in real-time straight from the cloud.
